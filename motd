Welcome to Alpine based ssh-server!

How does it work?
----------------
You should have a list of user's (public) ssh keys (in openssh format), 
  in a (separate) git repository. Then use the raw link of the 
  authorized_keys file from the master branch of that repository, 
  by passing it as an environment variable (`AUTH_KEYS_URL`) to the container. 
  The container pulls this file from the URL, 
  and stores it as `/home/sshuser/.ssh/authorized_keys`. 

Then, you can connect to this container using `sshuser` user account. 

Remember, by default, the user is not allowed interactive shell login, 
  because the purpose is just to use this container for "port-forwarding" 
  over SSH connection. 

If you want interactive login as well, you will need to pass 
  another environment variable (`ALLOW_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN`).
